e.g:\n\n```\nasync.auto({\n    task1: ['noexist', function(callback, results){\n        callback(null, 'task1');\n    }]\n});\n```\n- 2. cyclic dependencies; e.g:\n\n```\nasync.auto({\n    task1: ['task2', function(callback, results){\n        callback(null, 'task1');\n    }],\n    task2: ['task1', function(callback, results){\n        callback(null, 'task2');\n    }]\n});\n```\n- 3. self as dependency which is a subcase of `2.`; e.g:\n\n```\nasync.auto({\n    task1: ['task1', function(callback, results){\n        callback(null, 'task1');\n    }]\n});\n```\n\nIf any of these cases are encountered, a verbose `Error()` is thrown.\n\nIt is possible to improve the performance a little bit further by embedding these detections inside the `ready()` method because we already loop through the `requires` array during the `Array.reduce()` call:\n\n[Mickael-van-der-Beek/async@2410077e26d5429ac45533438f008706dcb989f7/lib/async.js#L492](https://github.com/Mickael-van-der-Beek/async/blob/2410077e26d5429ac45533438f008706dcb989f7/lib/async.js#L492)\n\nbut I felt that it would be a dirtier solution.\nIf you prefer the faster solution though, just ask and I'll create a new pull-request for it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/caolan/async/issues/663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/caolan/async/issues/663/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1,"files":[{"sha":"50f7a28063e2b04cd636913fa6bcca29f0b2fdc4","filename":"lib/async.js","status":"modified","additions":11,"deletions":0,"changes":11,"blob_url":"https://github.com/caolan/async/blob/74ea68b3761a1741b7c1769fb87d9725342d37ec/lib%2Fasync.js","raw_url":"https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/74ea68b3761a1741b7c1769fb87d9725342d37ec/lib%2Fasync.js","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/caolan/async/contents/lib%2Fasync.js?ref=74ea68b3761a1741b7c1769fb87d9725342d37ec","patch":"@@ -478,6 +478,17 @@\n                 }\n             };\n             var requires = task.slice(0, Math.abs(task.length - 1)) || [];\n+            // prevent dead-locks\n+            var len = requires.length;\n+            var dep;\n+            while (len--) {\n+                if (!(dep = tasks[requires[len]])) {\n+                    throw new Error('Has inexistant dependency');\n+                }\n+                if (_isArray(dep) && !!~dep.indexOf(k)) {\n+                    throw new Error('Has cyclic dependencies');\n+                }\n+            }\n             var ready = function () {\n                 return _reduce(requires, function (a, x) {\n                     return (a && results.hasOwnProperty(x));"},{"sha":"adada478517ceef30994b46bf7c83f0744379b94","filename":"test/test-async.js","status":"modified","additions":27,"deletions":0,"changes":27,"blob_url":"https://github.com/caolan/async/blob/74ea68b3761a1741b7c1769fb87d9725342d37ec/test%2Ftest-async.js","raw_url":"https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/74ea68b3761a1741b7c1769fb87d9725342d37ec/test%2Ftest-async.js","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/caolan/async/contents/test%2Ftest-async.js?ref=74ea68b3761a1741b7c1769fb87d9725342d37ec","patch":"@@ -580,6 +580,33 @@ exports['auto modifying results causes final callback to run early'] = function(\n     });\n };\n \n+// Issue 263 on github: https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/263\n+exports['auto prevent dead-locks due to inexistant dependencies'] = function(test) {\n+    test.throws(function () {\n+        async.auto({\n+            task1: ['noexist', function(callback, results){\n+                callback(null, 'task1');\n+            }]\n+        });\n+    }, Error);\n+    test.done();\n+};\n+\n+// Issue 263 on github: https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/263\n+exports['auto prevent dead-locks due to cyclic dependencies'] = function(test) {\n+    test.throws(function () {\n+        async.auto({\n+            task1: ['task2', function(callback, results){\n+                callback(null, 'task1');\n+            }],\n+            task2: ['task1', function(callback, results){\n+                callback(null, 'task2');\n+            }]\n+        });\n+    }, Error);\n+    test.done();\n+};\n+\n // Issue 306 on github: https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/306\n exports['retry when attempt succeeds'] = function(test) {\n     var failed = 3"}]}]
