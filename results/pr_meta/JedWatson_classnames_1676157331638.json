on https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames/pull/255, thanks to @markdalgleish for the base code.\r\nThis pull request shortcuts the `toString.toString()` workaround by ensuring it fails the existing `arg.toString !== Object.prototype.toString` first.\r\n\r\nSeeing as `toString` is an edge case in the first place, this balances our performance by having low to no impact in typical usage.\r\nWe have the option to shortcut with `hasOwnProperty('toString')` if that code path is desired, but I have opted out of that for now.\r\n\r\nBenchmark results for this pull request\r\n```\r\nMozilla/5.0
