PR updates the types for SourceCode so that the return type takes `includeComments` and any filter predicates into account.\r\n\r\nThe types as they're currently defined aren't wrong, but they are overly broad. `includeComments` defaults to false (e.g. [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/6791decfc58b7b09cfd0aabd15a3d14148aae073/lib/source-code/token-store/index.js#L78)). Filter predicates do just that. However, if you currently use a type guard in filter, it will have no effect on the resulting type (see modifications to existing test cases).\r\n\r\nThis PR achieves return type refinement by making these methods generic on their options, and then using a type transformer to compute the actual return type conditioned on the options. If a filter with a predicate is used, then it uses the predicate return type, otherwise it only returns comments if `includeComments` is true.\r\n\r\nI called this an RFC for two main reasons.\r\n1. I think this is an improvement because it makes the types more accurate, but it also makes the types more complicated which could\r\n   a. hurt type checking performance\r\n   b. make the type signatures less readable\r\n   I'm open to the argument that slightly more refined types is not worth those two negatives and therefore this shouldn't be checked in.\r\n2.

Placeholder support for curried functions\r\n- Placeholder support for auto-curried `fp` functions (fixes #24602)\r\n- Support importing `\"lodash/fp/placehoder\"` and the alias `\"lodash/fp/__\"`\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, since this required adding a ridiculous number of new overloads, it caused the tests to run out of memory. To fix the tests, I needed to do the following:\r\n- Removed parameterless generated overloads (e.g. `interface LodashPick { (): LodashPick; ... }`). I don't see any use case for these overloads (they don't really do anything), so I removed them to free up some space.\r\n- Removed all jsdoc comments from the `fp` function definitions. This is unfortunate, but it made the biggest difference by far in the performance of the tests.\r\n- Combined FP code into one file. Now all function definitions are inside `fp.d.ts`, instead of being distributed among hundreds of files. Unfortunately this change makes the diff very hard to read, but it's necessary in order to make the tests pass.\r\n\r\nSo there are some drawbacks, but I think the value of placeholder support outweighs them all.\r\n\r\nTemplate:\r\n\r\n- [x] Use a meaningful title for the pull request.

It retains\r\n\r\n1. string index signatures, so that arbitrary props can be passed in.\r\n2. extending from React.Componenent, so that individual types can be subclassed.\r\n3. Type parameters on the individual types.\r\n\r\nHowever, string index signatures can no longer be avoided, and type parameters are ignored. This preserves interface compatibility -- existing code will not break from this change -- but disables excess prop checking. It's possible that a breaking change that returns the type package to its old strict behaviour can be made at the same time as a breaking change of reactstrap itself.\r\n\r\nThis change improves performance dramatically, and allows linting to succeed without running out of memory.

Each interface contains all the methods of lodash, and each methods has overloads for each of the types supported by lodash -- list or object, for example. The overloads are distinguished by their `this` parameter. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface Wrapper<T> {\r\n  map<U, V>(this: List<U>, f: (u: U) => V): Wrapper<List<V>>;\r\n  map<U, V>(this: Dictionary<U>, f: (u: U) => V): Wrapper<List<V>>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is abysmally slow. With Typescript 3.3, completions take 8 seconds or so to show up. After this PR, they take 1 second. With Typescript 3.4, both the compiler and language service often run out of memory, but this is due to 3.4's over-reliance on structural comparison. 3.5 will return performance to that of 3.3.\r\n\r\nIt creates a gigantic type with every method in lodash, and each method has many overloads, and each overload is generic. And each overload has an extra parameter, the `this` parameter, that is almost always generic, and almost always a union. In order to compare instances of lodash wrappers, each method must be instantiated, including every one of its overloads. That means each overload must be instantiated, including every one of its parameters.\r\n\r\nUsing `this` parameters to dual-dispatch at compile-time is clever, but has two usability drawbacks as well:\r\n\r\n1. Error messages are \"The this-context 'number' does not match the type of the this parameter 'List<T> | null | undefined' for 'map'.\", not \"'map' is not found on 'Primitive'\".\r\n2. The language service attempts to work around this by filtering methods by their this context. However, this is extremely slow.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes lodash to use an inheritance hierarchy instead. `LodashImplicitWrapper` now has five subtypes: `Collection`, `Object`, `Function`, `String` and `Primitive`. Lodash's call signature now has overloads that produce each of these wrapper types.\r\n\r\nWith an inheritance hierarchy, LodashImplicitWrapper contains the shared methods that truly apply the same way to all types. Then each subtype contains type-specific methods. Each method has many fewer overloads -- often none at all -- and is usually not generic. And the number of parameters shrinks greatly without this parameters everywhere. It also means that error messages and language service responsiveness improve.\r\n\r\nThe two drawbacks are:\r\n\r\n1. More duplicated code, in particular methods like `concat` that apply *almost* the same way to each type, except for `Collection`. `Collection` can't unsoundly override a `concat` from `LodashImplicitWrapper`, so each subtype has to have its own `concat`.\r\n2. For `any`, showing all methods that *might* apply can be helpful for JS users. However, I think the situation is not that bad right now, and can perhaps be improved. `any` has its own overload with `_(any)`, which currently returns `Collection<any>` but could return an intersection type.\r\n\r\nNotes on implementation:\r\n\r\n1. The non-chaining methods are barely changed. There are some inefficiencies there, but the scale is pretty small since `LodashStatic` is never instantiated; it's just a big collection of generic signatures.\r\n2. The implementation uses conditional types and modern mapped-type distributivity to retain most of the chaining from the previous implementation. That is, if a List.reduce returns an object, it will be wrapped in an Object wrapper. If it returns a number, it will be wrapped in a Primitive wrapper. However, the conditional type is only used where it produces a better type &mdash; about 25 times. Most functions in lodash don't change the container type.\r\nUsing modern features makes this PR possible, but means that older versions of Typescript can't take advantage of it. I put the new code in a `ts3.1/` subdirectory so that both versions can be maintained until 2.x is old enough to drop support for.\r\n3. The most interesting part of the code is `common/common.d.ts` and `common/seq.d.ts`, which have the implicit chain constructor and explicit chain constructor, respectively.\r\n5. lowdb relies on lodash's chaining API, but created a copy of it using a script. The only thing the copy is used for is to distinguish the return type of `write` between the sync and async API in lowdb. Since lowdb is a rarely used package, and the return type of `write` is rarely used, I instead fudged its return type as `T & Promise<T>`, combined the sync and async APIs, and got rid of the script-generated copy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/35241/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/35241/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/30005","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/30005/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/30005/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/30005/events","html_url":"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/30005","id":373542821,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjI1NDUwMTA4","number":30005,"title":"[webpack] Configuration.performance option can be false","user":{"login":"vkrol","id":153412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkrol","html_url":"https://github.com/vkrol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkrol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkrol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkrol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkrol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkrol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkrol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkrol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkrol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkrol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":684321576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2ODQzMjE1NzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/labels/Popular%20package","name":"Popular package","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"This PR affects a popular package (as counted by NPM download counts)."},{"id":905334095,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDUzMzQwOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/labels/Owner%20Approved","name":"Owner Approved","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"A listed owner of this package signed off on the pull request."}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":15,"created_at":"2018-10-24T15:29:00Z","updated_at":"2018-11-08T09:50:48Z","closed_at":"2018-11-07T23:24:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pulls/30005","html_url":"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/30005","diff_url":"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/30005.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/30005.patch","merged_at":"2018-11-07T23:24:45Z"},"body":"Please fill in this template.\r\n\r\n- [x] Use a meaningful title for the pull request.

some further discussion about this in https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/30780 and on twitter, I thought about \"solving the problem\" once and for all with an official warning, but @sebmarkbage's position on this is more [in favor of just being explicit](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14894#issuecomment-465433212) than it being specifically necessary for correctness and/or performance reasons.\r\n\r\nGiven how in TypeScript it is possible to, through the use of overloads with specific arities and generic defaults, support this use case safely, I added some overloads with very specific constraints that allow you to omit the arguments to `useRef` and `useState`. `useReducer` could follow the same logic but its' typing situation is a lot more complicated and it's in need of a different refactoring; so for now it stays being 2-ary.\r\n\r\nAs for `useMemo`, I didn't allow the inputs list to be undefined for somewhat opinionated reasons (it's normally not very useful to memoize without a key); but there's at least one use case that's possibly not user error (see [this tweet](https://twitter.com/jessidhia/status/1093155905997234176)), so allow the

The Semantic UI packages however are a bit more vulnerable to pre-2.4 weak type behavior.\r\n\r\nI'm considering declaring settings types as a union of the types that result from making 1 property required (and the rest optional) and repeating for each property. The resulting union won't be a weak type since each member has 1 required property.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n```typescript\r\ntype StrictOptions = {\r\n    a: boolean;\r\n    b?: string;\r\n} | {\r\n    a?: boolean;\r\n    b: string;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Using mapped types**\r\n\r\nFrom [global.d.ts](https://github.com/leonard-thieu/DefinitelyTyped/blob/4afdb3881dacc6e7dd123820a143167247d8a4f9/types/semantic-ui-accordion/global.d.ts#L42):\r\n```typescript\r\ntype Param = (Pick<_Impl, 'exclusive'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'on'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'animateChildren'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'closeNested'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'collapsible'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'duration'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'easing'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'observeChanges'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'onOpening'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'onOpen'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'onClosing'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'onClose'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'onChange'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'selector'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'className'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'error'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'namespace'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'name'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'silent'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'debug'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'performance'> |\r\n    Pick<_Impl, 'verbose'>) &\r\n    Partial<Pick<_Impl, keyof _Impl>>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `_Impl` is the settings type with all properties non-optional.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis _seems_ to work correctly and I believe should work for 2.1+.

For an example, see “Constellations of Directors and their Stars” (The New York Times).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/4062/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/4062/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/2044","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/2044/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/2044/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/2044/events","html_url":"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/2044","id":31584601,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTQ3ODkyNTg=","number":2044,"title":"Update lodash.d.ts to support TypeScript 1.0","user":{"login":"david-driscoll","id":1269157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjkxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1269157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-driscoll","html_url":"https://github.com/david-driscoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-driscoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-driscoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-driscoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-driscoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-driscoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-driscoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-driscoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-driscoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-driscoll/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2014-04-15T19:45:59Z","updated_at":"2014-07-17T11:36:38Z","closed_at":"2014-05-08T11:03:22Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pulls/2044","html_url":"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/2044","diff_url":"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/2044.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/2044.patch","merged_at":"2014-05-08T11:03:22Z"},"body":"With the removal of parts of the Type Inference system the interface Collection<T> fails to work with List<T>, 0 Array<T>, and Dictionary<T>.  \n\nThis change breaks out all instances of Collection<T> into Array<T>, List<T> and Dictionary<T>.  Also we further break out instances of List<T> into Array<T> and List<T> to support Array's and Array Like Objects.  This should address most of the issues found in #1759.\n\nI know this change is a lot more definition code that we previously had, but I do not see TypeScript gaining back the lostType Inference any time soon.  Mainly it seems like the performance loss was too drastic in the compiler.\n\nThere are still a few things in the tests that fail, but they have to do with reduce / reduceRight, I did not address those as part of this Pull Request.  It appears for the accumulator to work correctly it has to be strongly typed, and can not be inferred.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/2044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/2044/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/1561","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/1561/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/1561/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/1561/events","html_url":"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/1561","id":25848153,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTE2NDMwMzc=","number":1561,"title":"Created definitions for bluebird","user":{"login":"Bartvds","id":685984,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTk4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/685984?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartvds","html_url":"https://github.com/Bartvds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartvds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartvds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartvds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartvds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartvds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartvds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartvds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartvds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bartvds/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2014-01-18T00:15:30Z","updated_at":"2014-01-18T07:48:52Z","closed_at":"2014-01-18T06:19:00Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pulls/1561","html_url":"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/1561","diff_url":"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/1561.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/1561.patch","merged_at":"2014-01-18T06:19:00Z"},"body":"\"Bluebird is a full featured promise library with unmatched performance.\"\nhttps://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird\n\nknown issues:\n- maybe needs a global var or single export?\n- uses 'any'-type (not generic-enabled)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/1561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/1561/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1}]
