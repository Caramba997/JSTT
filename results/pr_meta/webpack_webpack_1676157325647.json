After speaking with @fhinkel and a few other members of the V8 team, we were recommended that we use this heuristic technique. The change is very minimal in that in converts the output template to go from: \r\n\r\n```\r\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\r\n\t\tvar add = __webpack_require__(/*! ./math */ 1).add;\r\n\t\texports.increment = function(val) {\r\n\t\t\treturn add(val, 1);\r\n\t\t};\r\n/***/ },\r\n```\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n```\r\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\r\n\t\tvar add = __webpack_require__(/*! ./math */ 1).add;\r\n\t\texports.increment = function(val) {\r\n\t\t\treturn add(val, 1);\r\n\t\t};\r\n/***/ }),\r\n```\r\n\r\nOverall findings by @nolanlawson state that load and performance gains of over 10%-50% depending on browser engine. https://github.com/nolanlawson/optimize-js#benchmark-overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change.
