Only applicable to the inflate and deflate algorithms.`)\r\n\r\nRecently we have introduced/enabled `server_no_context_takeover` on one of our canary production servers which i monitor with nodejs with the help of this ws library (approx 250 connections on a single nodejs process connecting to the server).\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of `server_no_context_takeover` i have noticed significantly increased CPU usage on the client of approx 2x (8% -> 16%) to what it was before the parameter was added).\r\n\r\nI have traced it down to significantly higher GC activity, which went from ~**100ms** total time/minute to ~**500ms**.\r\nWhen it comes to actual GC counts, it went from ~**25 GC**/minute to ~**150**.\r\nMinor GCs almost stopped and majority of the time was spent in the major GCs and incremental GCs.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this overhead appears to be the constant destruction/re-initialization of the `zlib.createInflateRaw`.\r\nThe attached changes eliminate this overhead, and brings the performance back in line to where it was before the `server_no_context_takeover` parameter was introduced.\r\nThe changes are holding up fine in production/i haven't encountered any issues so far.\r\n\r\nI don't know if there are any potential side-effects of the below changes, the changes do pass all the tests currently available for the library (although i am not sure the current tests would catch compressor/decompressor \"corruption\" resulting from the changes in this PR, at least i wasn't able to run into such case so far). \r\n\r\nRunning the available speed.js points towards a very minor throughput improvement for the 5000 roundtrips part of the test.\r\nEach benchmark run fluctuates quite a bit on my work machine so i opted for not posting the results here.\r\n\r\nI am attaching a set of graphs showing the performance \r\n1. before `server_no_context_takeover` was introduced on the server side\r\n2. with the current WS library version

However, you might be missing out on a bunch of new features, fixes and/or performance improvements from the dependency update.\n\nIt might be worth looking into these changes and trying to get this project onto the latest version of eslint.\n\nIf you have a solid test suite and good coverage, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes directly by merging the proposed change into your project. If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.\n\n\n---\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Release Notes</summary>\n<strong>v4.10.0</strong>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/commit/bb6e60a0eec42e5614a537d9766e8ef42dc806ed\" class=\"commit-link\"><tt>bb6e60a</tt></a> Fix: Improve the doc for no-restricted-modules rule (fixes <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/issues/9437\" class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"265463875\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9437\">#9437</a>) (<a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/pull/9495\" class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"267372374\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9495\">#9495</a>) (vibss2397)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/commit/c529de90451d439b411a5e398e628ae860973f04\" class=\"commit-link\"><tt>c529de9</tt></a> Docs: Amend rule document to correct and complete it (refs <a href=\"https://urls.greenkeeper.io/eslint/eslint/issues/6251\" class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"156726543\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6251\">#6251</a>).
