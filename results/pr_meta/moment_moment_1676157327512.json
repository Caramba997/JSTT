changes to `startOf` and `endOf` fix several DST-related issues:\r\n- avoid using setHours/setMinutes/setSeconds - fixes #1990, fixes #2749, fixes #3580\r\n- use `Date.UTC` / `new Date` for units bigger than hours - fixes #3132, fixes #4152\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the changes supersede these pull requests: #3620, #4164 and #4254 \r\n\r\nBenchmark results\r\n\r\n| Benchmark | moment 2.19.3 | this

`moment('0000-02-29')` was created in year 1900 then reverted to year 0.  Unfortunately Feb 29th doesn't exist in 1900, so the moment ended up as `0000-03-01` instead.\r\n\r\nNew tests have been added to `start_end_of.js` that would have failed in earlier releases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/moment/moment/issues/4338/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":7,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/moment/moment/issues/4338/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1}]
