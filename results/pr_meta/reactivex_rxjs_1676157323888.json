should have a type definition test at the end of the spec to verify type definition for various use cases\n- [ ] The operator must be documented in JSDoc style in the implementation file, including also the PNG marble diagram image\n- [ ] The operator should be listed in `doc/operators.md` in a category of operators\n- [ ] It should also be inserted in the operator decision tree file

was going through the `ReplaySubject` class and I think in some situations it can be simplified. Most importantly when I don't set the `timeWindow` parameter the buffer trimming method can be avoided completely and I can store just the values without wrapping them with `ReplayEvent`.\r\n\r\nAlso, I tried some performance tests to see whether `splice()` or `shift()` would be better. It seems that running `shift()` in a for loop is faster than `splice()` when removing `< 25` items. However, `splice()` is more consistent even when removing a large portion of an array. See https://jsperf.com/splice-vs-shift-2\r\n\r\nThere were no benchmarks for Subjects in `perf` directory so I made a few myself but I'm not sure I'm testing it the right way.
