(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nI upgraded `@humanwhocodes/config-array` to the latest version. This includes a [caching change](https://github.com/humanwhocodes/config-array/commit/8a7e8ab499bcbb10d7cbdd676197fc686966a64e) to cache by matching indices, similar to what [eslintrc does](https://github.com/eslint/eslintrc/blob/9e1d1b324dba199492a7cccb56d873c1d4fa0730/lib/config-array/config-array.js#L474-L484). In theory this should improve runtime performance, although running it with `npm run perf` didn't actually seem to improve the numbers, and in fact, may have made them worse. 🤷

The error can be either that the pattern doesn't match any files or that it matches only ignored files.\r\n\r\nThe difference is that ESLint always throws an error for the very first unmatched pattern, while FlatESLint first checks if there are patterns that match ignored files.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, run `eslint \"doesnotexist/*.js\" \"tests/fixtures/*.js\"`.\r\n\r\nESLint:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOops! Something went wrong! :(\r\n\r\nESLint: 8.27.0\r\n\r\nNo files matching the pattern \"doesnotexist/*.js\" were found.\r\nPlease check for typing mistakes in the pattern.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFlatESLint:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOops! Something went wrong! :(\r\n\r\nESLint: 8.27.0\r\n\r\nYou are linting \"tests/fixtures/*.js\", but all of the files matching the glob pattern \"tests/fixtures/*.js\" are ignored.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to lint these files, remove the pattern \"tests/fixtures/*.js\" from the list of arguments passed to ESLint.\r\n\r\nIf you do want to lint these files, try the following solutions:\r\n\r\n* Check your .eslintignore file, or the eslintIgnore property in package.json, to ensure that the files are not configured to be ignored.\r\n* Explicitly list the files from this glob that you'd like to lint on the command-line, rather than providing a glob as an argument.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's an error either way, but I think ESLint behavior is preferable as it would be surprising for users that after fixing or removing the reported pattern, eslint in the next run reports an error for a preceding pattern. Checking only the first pattern also simplifies the code a bit, and is better for performance in this, albeit exceptional, scenario.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    If the item you've checked above has a template, please paste the template questions below and answer them.

Note that this isn't observable with `TIMING` because it tracks only time spent in visitors.\r\n\r\n#### What changes did you make? (Give an overview)\r\n\r\nAs esquery [hardcodes](https://github.com/estools/esquery/blob/7c3800a4b2ff5c7b3eb3b2cf742865b7c908981f/esquery.js#L229-L232) `:function` to only three exact types, I added them as the only possible types for `:function`. This improves the performance of `no-shadow-restricted-names` by the said 95%, and will also improve the execution time for any other rule with the `:function` selector in tail positions. We're not using that selector much in core rules, but it's used in plugins.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense? I don't expect any maintenance problems with this as the meaning of `:function` in esquery is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15181/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15190","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15190/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15190/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/15190/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/15190","id":1030915492,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAKjKDc4tai1b","number":15190,"title":"Chore: fix counting of files in performance test","user":{"login":"mdjermanovic","id":44349756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzQ5NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44349756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic","html_url":"https://github.com/mdjermanovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdjermanovic/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":131106229,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzExMDYyMjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"There is consensus among the team that this change meets the criteria for inclusion"},{"id":360091515,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNjAwOTE1MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/chore","name":"chore","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"This change is not user-facing"},{"id":829215248,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjkyMTUyNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/archived%20due%20to%20age","name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee","default":false,"description":"This issue has been archived; please open a new issue for any further discussion"}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2021-10-20T02:42:25Z","updated_at":"2022-04-20T00:57:44Z","closed_at":"2021-10-21T11:08:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/pulls/15190","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/15190","diff_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/15190.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/15190.patch","merged_at":"2021-10-21T11:08:56Z"},"body":"<!--\r\n    Thank you for contributing!\r\n\r\n    ESLint adheres to the [JS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://js.foundation/community/code-of-conduct).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Prerequisites checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n\r\n#### What is the purpose of this pull request?

(Give an overview)\r\n\r\nFor the last several weeks, our CI jobs have been flaky due to test hook timeouts on the Windows and macOS runners. I traced most of the failures to four `before` hooks that copy the test fixtures to a temporary directory. They usually take ~2.5s, but that occasionally spikes to tens of seconds: in the two times I was able to repro the timeouts, the slowest copy jobs were 25 ([output](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/runs/1269555746#step:5:25)) and 32 seconds.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?\r\n\r\n- Rather than increasing the global test timeout, I instead bumped it just for these four hooks that were causing problems. Is the narrower approach acceptable?\r\n- The previous timeout was 10 seconds. Is 60 seconds for these four hooks too much? In 8 samples (2 successful repros &times; 4 hooks), the longest I saw was 32 seconds.\r\n- Since these hooks just call out to the shell, I didn't try to do any optimization that might speed up these operations. Is there something easy I missed? My guess is that resource contention on shared runners is causing slow filesystem performance, but I haven't proven that's the original cause.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13768/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13768/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13408","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13408/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13408/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/13408/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/13408","id":636525099,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDMyNjgxNTcy","number":13408,"title":"Update: rename id-blacklist to id-denylist (fixes #13407)","user":{"login":"kaicataldo","id":7041728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDE3Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7041728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicataldo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicataldo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":45711352,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0NTcxMTM1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true,"description":"This change enhances an existing feature of ESLint"},{"id":82922548,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjkyMjU0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/core","name":"core","color":"c7def8","default":false,"description":"Relates to ESLint's core APIs and features"},{"id":131106229,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzExMDYyMjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/accepted","name":"accepted","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"There is consensus among the team that this change meets the criteria for inclusion"},{"id":829215248,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjkyMTUyNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/archived%20due%20to%20age","name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee","default":false,"description":"This issue has been archived;

(Give an overview)**\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand the issue, the filtering of files/directories during globbing must pass absolute paths to the filtering function with the trailing slash present for directories to distinguish them from files, and the relative path extracted from the absolute path in this function must preserve the trailing slash as well since the relative path is passed to `ignore` package afterward, and it can not \"unignore\" directories that are \"marked\" as files (have no trailing slash).\r\n\r\n~~First of all, I've noticed that the `_mark()`ing in the overridden `GlobSync.prototype._readdir()` method didn't add the trailing slash to the path, IIUC due to the fact that it only uses cache to check if the path points to a directory and this cache is not created until the first call to the parent's `_readdir()` method, thus I've changed the order in which these methods are called.~~\r\n\r\n~~Secondly, I've changed the `getRelativePath()` function's behavior to preserve the trailing slash.~~\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\n~~The change to the `getRelativePath()` function is also related to the `IgnoredPaths.prototype.getIgnoredFoldersGlobChecker()` method's behavior and changes it implicitly.~~\r\n\r\n~~Also, even though paths are cached inside the `glob.GlobSync` instance, I am not sure if this does not significantly degrade the performance of globbing, I would like to get some help with the benchmarking of this change.~~\r\n\r\nEDIT: Some parts of the description above are no longer relevant after https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/11546 has landed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/11685/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10935","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10935/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10935/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/10935/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/10935","id":367597202,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjIwOTc1NzIw","number":10935,"title":"Chore: Simplify space-infix-ops","user":{"login":"madbence","id":296735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjczNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/296735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madbence","html_url":"https://github.com/madbence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madbence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madbence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madbence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madbence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madbence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madbence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madbence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madbence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madbence/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":360091515,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNjAwOTE1MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/chore","name":"chore","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"This change is not user-facing"},{"id":829215248,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjkyMTUyNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/archived%20due%20to%20age","name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee","default":false,"description":"This issue has been archived; please open a new issue for any further discussion"}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-10-07T21:49:18Z","updated_at":"2019-04-11T08:07:43Z","closed_at":"2018-10-12T18:48:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/pulls/10935","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/10935","diff_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/10935.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/10935.patch","merged_at":"2018-10-12T18:48:29Z"},"body":"**What is the purpose of this pull request?

Matching a regex against all identifiers seems unlikely to be a major performance bottleneck compared to some other rules which do much more performance-intensive tasks.\r\n\r\n(I noticed this as a result of https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9538.)\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\nNothing in particular\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9544/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9364","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9364/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9364/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9364/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/9364","id":261123708,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTQzNTA0NzY1","number":9364,"title":"Chore: avoid handling rules instances in config-validator","user":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":360091515,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNjAwOTE1MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/chore","name":"chore","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"This change is not user-facing"},{"id":829215248,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjkyMTUyNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/archived%20due%20to%20age","name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee","default":false,"description":"This issue has been archived; please open a new issue for any further discussion"}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-09-27T21:27:34Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T20:03:47Z","closed_at":"2017-11-10T07:57:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/pulls/9364","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/9364","diff_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/9364.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/9364.patch","merged_at":"2017-11-10T07:57:28Z"},"body":"<!--\r\n    ESLint adheres to the [JS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://js.foundation/community/code-of-conduct).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What is the purpose of this pull request?

(Give an overview)**\r\n\r\nThis updates `Linter#verify` to only create a report translating function for a given rule after the rule has already reported a problem for a given file. When running ESLint on any given file, it's common for a vast majority of rules to not report any errors. This avoids creating an extra two functions in the common case, which has a significant effect on performance because creating `ruleContext`s is a hot path.\r\n\r\nI tested the performance impact by running ESLint on its own codebase 5 times with and without this change applied, and taking the average time of the 5 runs in each case.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ntime bin/eslint.js 'tests/**/*.js' 'bin/**/*.js' 'lib/**/*.js' 'tools/**/*.js' 'conf/**/*.js' --rulesdir lib/internal-rules/ --ignore-pattern lib/linter.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I added `lib/linter.js` as an ignore pattern because this change modifies the contents of `lib/linter.js`, which could skew the results.)\r\n\r\nWithout this change applied, the average time was 15.11s. With this change applied, the average time was 14.66s, which is around a 3% end-to-end performance boost.\r\n\r\n`npm run perf` reports no change in performance. I suspect this is because the `npm run perf` test includes an unusually large number of reported errors (see https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/9184)\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\nNothing in particular","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9221/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9260","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9260/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9260/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9260/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/9260","id":256353145,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTQwMTExOTE0","number":9260,"title":"Chore: refactor config hash caching in CLIEngine","user":{"login":"not-an-aardvark","id":11638619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjM4NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11638619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark","html_url":"https://github.com/not-an-aardvark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/not-an-aardvark/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":360091515,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNjAwOTE1MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/chore","name":"chore","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"This change is not user-facing"},{"id":829215248,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjkyMTUyNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/archived%20due%20to%20age","name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee","default":false,"description":"This issue has been archived; please open a new issue for any further discussion"}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-09-08T19:45:26Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T06:10:17Z","closed_at":"2017-09-08T22:58:23Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/pulls/9260","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/9260","diff_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/9260.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/9260.patch","merged_at":"2017-09-08T22:58:23Z"},"body":"<!--\r\n    ESLint adheres to the [JS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://js.foundation/community/code-of-conduct).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What is the purpose of this pull request?

On `master`, it takes about 3.5 seconds to run all 751 `indent` tests, but after reverting this change it takes about 2.3 seconds.\r\n\r\nEventually, it would be nice to reapply this commit, but we will probably need to add a way to get a single defined rule from a `Linter` instance to make it workable, rather than getting a map of hundreds of rules.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\nNothing in particular","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/9295/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/8763","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/8763/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/8763/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/8763/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/8763","id":236756225,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTI2MjA4NTM4","number":8763,"title":"Chore: Only instantiate fileEntryCache when cache flage set (perf)","user":{"login":"gyandeeps","id":5554486,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTQ0ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5554486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps","html_url":"https://github.com/gyandeeps","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyandeeps/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":360091515,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNjAwOTE1MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/chore","name":"chore","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"This change is not user-facing"},{"id":829215248,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjkyMTUyNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/archived%20due%20to%20age","name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee","default":false,"description":"This issue has been archived; please open a new issue for any further discussion"}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-06-19T00:38:50Z","updated_at":"2018-02-06T20:56:18Z","closed_at":"2017-06-21T22:13:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/pulls/8763","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/8763","diff_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/8763.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/8763.patch","merged_at":"2017-06-21T22:13:32Z"},"body":"**What is the purpose of this pull request?

Although property keys are Identifier nodes, non-computed property keys are really strings at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nWell, that's where we started, but then we decided to ensure that destructuring and import/export were handled correctly. In order to do that more reliably and (hopefully) ensure the rule keeps up with no syntax, I decided to refactor to use escope variables. This ended up improving performance by about 80% (at least when the rule is run on our codebase), so that's a huge win. (Identifer visitor was hit a lot, so even the performance penalty of iterating over scopes again still made this rule much faster overall.)\r\n\r\nLabeling as \"Update\" in case more warnings are introduced in destructuring or import/export cases.\r\n\r\n**Is there anything you'd like reviewers to focus on?**\r\n\r\nDoes this need a documentation update?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/7966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/7966/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/6661","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/6661/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/6661/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/6661/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/6661","id":165259137,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzcyNDQ4ODI=","number":6661,"title":"chore: combine multiple RegEx replaces with one","user":{"login":"thefourtheye","id":696611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjYxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefourtheye","html_url":"https://github.com/thefourtheye","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefourtheye/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefourtheye/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefourtheye/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefourtheye/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefourtheye/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefourtheye/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefourtheye/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefourtheye/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefourtheye/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":829215248,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjkyMTUyNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/archived%20due%20to%20age","name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee","default":false,"description":"This issue has been archived; please open a new issue for any further discussion"}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2016-07-13T07:55:03Z","updated_at":"2018-02-06T22:41:31Z","closed_at":"2016-07-15T02:05:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/pulls/6661","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/6661","diff_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/6661.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/6661.patch","merged_at":"2016-07-15T02:05:59Z"},"body":"**What issue does this pull request address?**\n\nPerformance improvement\n\n**What changes did you make?

The problem I came across was an extremely weird edge-case that I have not been able to reproduce manually. However, I think my fix is pretty simple and the rationale should make sense regardless.\n\nAt the point where my change has been made (ie: `executeOnFile()`), there is a `fs.realpathSync()` call that was throwing in the case described by #3978. The file in question was known by ESLint to be ignored, but the realpath call was happening before the early return. I've changed it to exit early once the file is known to be ignored, before running the risk of `fs.realpathSync()` throwing an uncaught exception.\n\nI'm sure there are other (edge) cases where this `fs.realpathSync()` could throw in this small window, but this prevents errors happening for files that should be ignored in the first place. Not to mention, there's no reason to add the performance penalty of a sync fs call for a file that will just be ignored anyways.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/3989/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/3989/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/2709","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/2709/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/2709/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/2709/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/2709","id":85645967,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzcwNzUzNjE=","number":2709,"title":"Fix: no-trailing-spaces now handles skipBlankLines (fixes #2575)","user":{"login":"gcochard","id":2836237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzYyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2836237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcochard","html_url":"https://github.com/gcochard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcochard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcochard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcochard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcochard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcochard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcochard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcochard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcochard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcochard/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":829215248,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjkyMTUyNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/archived%20due%20to%20age","name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee","default":false,"description":"This issue has been archived; please open a new issue for any further discussion"}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-06-05T22:22:08Z","updated_at":"2018-02-07T01:06:27Z","closed_at":"2015-06-06T18:34:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/pulls/2709","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/2709","diff_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/2709.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/2709.patch","merged_at":"2015-06-06T18:34:29Z"},"body":"This does potentially two regexp tests per line.

It's a from-scratch rewrite, without looking at any of the old code.\n\nIt splits all of the token handling out of the core and into a new `TokenStore` class. This also greatly simplifies the token-handling tests.\n\nRather than searching linearly through ranges until hitting upon a matching token, `TokenStore` indexes based on the start and end of every token. This greatly simplifies logic inside of the API methods and improves performance because every token is accessible directly, no searching required. Furthermore, because tokens are still stored in the original array, there's no traversal required to reconstruct a contiguous array from the sparse array that was used before; all that's required is a call to `slice`.\n\nNow for the performance data. All of this was obtained on a MacBook Pro with a 2nd-generation i7 running OS X Yosemite. Last time there was a performance regression on at least one machine, so help testing this on a variety of configurations is appreciated.\n\n``` sh\n$ git co master && npm run perf\n\nCPU Speed is 2200 with multiplier 7500000\nPerformance Run #1:  1499.543745ms\nPerformance Run #2:  1489.026796ms\nPerformance Run #3:  1489.335957ms\nPerformance Run #4:  1493.5138259999999ms\nPerformance Run #5:  1480.386587ms\nPerformance budget ok:  1489.335957ms (limit: 3409.090909090909ms)\n\n$ git co token-store && npm run perf\n\nCPU Speed is 2200 with multiplier 7500000\nPerformance Run #1:  1404.387172ms\nPerformance Run #2:  1366.972328ms\nPerformance Run #3:  1364.019312ms\nPerformance Run #4:  1369.947872ms\nPerformance Run #5:  1353.955682ms\nPerformance budget ok:  1366.972328ms (limit: 3409.090909090909ms)\n```\n\nI created a custom config to enable only the rules that call the tokens API, and the performance difference in some of the rules between master (time 1) and this PR (time 2) is significant:\n\n| Rule | Time 1 (ms) | Time 2 (ms) | Difference |\n| :-- | --: | --: | --: |\n| no-extra-parens | 115.493 | 102.774 | -11% |\n| no-multi-spaces | 54.537 | 43.220 | -21% |\n| no-spaced-func | 53.051 | 24.109 | -55% |\n| space-in-brackets | 46.095 | 16.625 | -64% |\n| space-infix-ops | 27.661 | 24.942 | -9.8% |\n| no-empty-class | 26.492 | 14.497 | -45% |\n| no-div-regex | 19.175 | 18.509 | -3.4% |\n| brace-style | 18.792 | 18.292 | -2.7% |\n| semi | 17.413 | n/a | n/a |\n| no-regex-spaces | 15.793 | 14.131 | -11% |\n| wrap-regex | n/a | 14.940 | n/a |\n\n_Edit: I tested this on an Ubuntu VM in Azure that I happen to have handy, and the performance results showed improvement there too: 5499.9859ms on `master`, dropping to 5237.867ms for this PR._\n\n_Edit 2: One more change, just a tiny bit faster._\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/1514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/1514/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/1446","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/1446/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/1446/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/1446/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/1446","id":47996679,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjQwMDE2NTQ=","number":1446,"title":"New: Add ability to time individual rules (fixes #1437)","user":{"login":"btmills","id":1709537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDk1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills","html_url":"https://github.com/btmills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/btmills/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":829215248,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjkyMTUyNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/archived%20due%20to%20age","name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee","default":false,"description":"This issue has been archived; please open a new issue for any further discussion"}],"state":"closed","locked":true,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2014-11-06T18:29:08Z","updated_at":"2018-02-07T01:48:24Z","closed_at":"2014-11-12T00:20:56Z","author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/pulls/1446","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/1446","diff_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/1446.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/1446.patch","merged_at":"2014-11-12T00:20:56Z"},"body":"My timing branch is to the point where I'd like some input and feedback before this gets merged.

This allows token-related methods to traverse directly between tokens rather than looking for the next extant index in the hash table.\n\nI also tried storing tokens in a non-sparse array so I could do something like `return currentTokens.slice(begin, end);`, but that actually ended up being slower than the linked list method. I still have the code in another branch if someone wants to look at it.\n\nThis did require one external change in the `space-infix-ops` rule. It was fabricating an artificial `ASTNode` to pass to `getTokens`, and in some circumstances the mock node had invalid range indices. With the change, it still creates a fake node, but it ensures that the range is valid.\n\nI suspect there are further gains either within the tokens API or in the rules that use it, which is why the commit message `refs` rather than `fixes`.

I know @nzakas was running into this same problem before.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/738/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/733","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/733/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/733/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/issues/733/events","html_url":"https://github.com/eslint/eslint/pull/733","id":30450362,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTQxNDUzOTQ=","number":733,"title":"Build: Add perf check into Travis build to better monitor performance","user":{"login":"nzakas","id":38546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas","html_url":"https://github.com/nzakas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzakas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":829215248,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjkyMTUyNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eslint/eslint/labels/archived%20due%20to%20age","name":"archived due to age","color":"eeeeee","default":false,"description":"This issue has been archived;

Probably not a greatest idea to upload the whole jshint file into our repository, but none of the files in eslint are big enough to show slowness of some of the advanced rules.
